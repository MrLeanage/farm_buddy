      "description": "A tall variety with an erect growth habit which attains a height of 75 - 100 cm, depending on the soil type. It is more suitable for cultivation during the maha season in rainfed uplands, but it is susceptible to leaf curl complex (LCC) and anthracnose, and therefore, gives comparatively low yields of about 1000 - 2000 kg ha-1 of dry chillies. The pods have a moderate pungency and are green becoming red coloured when ripe. The fruit surface is weakly wrinkled; the calyx is enveloping and the fruit ends are acute and strongly tapered.",
